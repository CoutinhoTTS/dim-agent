# 013: Command output ownership

Decision status: Proposed.

Extends ADR 010 and the session-file ownership model in
[`session-files.md`](../design/appserver/session-files.md) §11.1. This decision makes command
output, offloaded `read` results and background logs session-owned artifacts, so copied history
can read them after the source session is deleted. ADR 003 is unchanged.

## Context

Two producers hand host output paths to the model. WorkspaceTools writes under
`<database dir>/command-output/<session>/`: `exec` logs and offloaded `read` results. The
persistent shell writes under `<HostPlatform.home>/.dim/exec/<session>/<branch>/`. Neither has a
`session_files` row or id; a log can grow while a command runs; delete removes the directory. A
fork's copied history quotes those paths, so ownership has to follow a row, not the source
directory.

## Decision

### D1. Two tables, one fact

Attachments keep `session_file_owners (session_id, file_id)`. Output uses
`session_output_owners (session_id, path)`. Both feed the `session-owned` fact defined by ADR 014;
the fact reads both tables.

Two keys are deliberate. Output has no `session_files` row or id, is appended while running and
is removed as a directory. A single polymorphic table would need a nullable key, could not use
the `session_files` foreign key and would filter every sweep by kind. The second table exists so
a fork can read output after the source is deleted; without that requirement the current
directory rule is cheaper.

### D2. Registration

WorkspaceTools and the persistent shell both call `register(session_id, path)` before they return
the tool result that hands the path to the model. If registration fails, the call fails; a path
with no row is unowned. Each checks only its own root: `<database dir>/command-output/<session>/`
for WorkspaceTools, `<HostPlatform.home>/.dim/exec/<session>/<branch>/` for the shell. It guards
misuse among trusted parts, not isolation.

`exec` output, offloaded `read` results, a running background log and shell output all register.
A log may grow after registration; ownership is stable.

### D3. Queries and escapes

`owns(session_id, path)` resolves the path, then:

- an attachment requires the path to stay inside
  `<db>.session-files/<fileId>/` for an owned file id;
- output requires the exact registered path.

`..`, symlinks and an unresolvable path are denied. `owned_paths(session_id)` queries the rows
and returns the attachment path from its file-id directory and the output path from its row; it
is not one primary-key read. A query failure denies.

### D4. Fork, delete and growth

A fork copies every current row in both tables at the fork's commit, including a row registered
by a command that was still running at the fork point. The fork owns those files; a file the
source registers later is not owned.

Delete releases the session's rows. Either output directory — `command-output/<session>/` or
`.dim/exec/<session>/<branch>/` — is removed only when no row names any path under it; the last
owner removes it. This replaces the unconditional directory removal in
`session-deletion-and-fork.md`, which recorded the old rule because no row named the output.

The new table is part of the next native storage format version; its upgrade creates it empty,
and a failed upgrade rolls back.

Command output may grow after a fork. The fork owns the file and reads its current content; a
point-in-time copy is a separate concern.

### D5. Process start

A process start asks the ownership owner for the session's artifact paths. Workspace and platform
roots are ADR 010's mounts; grants are ADR 012's mounts. This decision owns the artifact mounts:
an owned path outside the session's own writable output root is mounted read-only; a path inside
that root is already writable and is not mounted again, so the sandbox overlap check is not
triggered. Inherited output outside the current root is mounted read-only. A running persistent
shell keeps the mounts it started with.

## Consequences

- A new `session_output_owners` table, a native format version and `register`, `owns`,
  `owned_paths`.
- `native-storage-format.md`, `session-deletion-and-fork.md`, `session-files.md` §11, the
  Attachments, WorkspaceTools and shell-session designs, the CLI tables and the `session-owned`
  source row in ADR 014 are updated under their owners after acceptance.
- No Timeline event is added; the table is storage state. The decision reverses the S5c rejection
  of keeping a source's output for its forks, as recorded in `session-deletion-and-fork.md`.

## Supersession

Extends ADR 010 and uses ADR 014's `session-owned` fact; ADR 012 owns the grant mounts. It
reverses the S5c decision in `session-deletion-and-fork.md` that removed an output directory
unconditionally. ADR 003 remains as written.

## Non-goals

- A new file-access rule; output uses ADR 014's `session-owned` fact.
- Copying output at fork; growth is a separate concern.
- Registering paths outside the caller's output directory.

## Rule check

| Rule | Application |
| --- | --- |
| §1, ADR 002 D1 | Ownership stays in the session-files owner; WorkspaceTools and the persistent shell keep producing output. |
| §4 rule 1 | Registration is a typed owner operation; no command event. |
| §4 rule 2 | The model reads the registered path; no call handover changes. |
| §4 rule 3 | No `before` callback. |
| §4 rule 4 | No core mechanism change. |
| §4 rule 5 | No Timeline batch. |
| §4 rule 6 | No context-input change. |
| §4 rule 7 | Both producers call the session-files owner; no other plugin state. |
| §4 rule 8 | No infrastructure change; the native table is a storage format version owned by SessionStore. |
| §4 rule 9 | No new Timeline fact. |
| ADR 002 D2 | No wiring plugin. |
| ADR 002 D3 | Ownership is session-files state; file tools and process start read it. |
| ADR 002 D4 | Business state in the native store, read at use time. |
| ADR 002 D5 | `register`, `owns` and `owned_paths` are language-neutral contracts. |
